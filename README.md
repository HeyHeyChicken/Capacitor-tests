## 👋 Introduction

This project is a test of [capacitorjs](//capacitorjs.com).<br/>
I wanted to transform an [Angular](//angular.io) development into a mobile application.<br/>
I was able to experiment with a good part of the functionalities offered by this cross-platform native runtime.<br/>
<br/>
Don't hesitate to try it out for yourself.
